# CS--300 Reflection

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  
  For Project one, the challenge was to analyze the run time and memory usage of various data structures to better understand their efficiency in different scenarios. In Project two, I built a program that sorts and displays a list of computer science courses in alphanumerical order. Both projects focused on using data structures and algorithms to solve problems in an effective and logical way.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  
  I began each project by breaking the task into smaller steps. For project one, I focused on understanding the strngeths and weaknesses of each data strucutre, comparing their performance in specific operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. For Project two, I reviewed different sorting algorithms and picked one that worked well for the given requirements. Understanding data structures is critical because the right choice can drastically impact the speed and efficiency of a program, and these projects really reinforced that for me. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  
  There were a few roadblocks along the way. In project two, for example, I ran into issues with certain edge cases that were not sorting correctly. To fix this, I spent time testing my program with different inputs and added print statements to debug the logic step by step. When I could not fiure it out on my own, I went back to the course materials and browsed google for any resource that could assist me. Taking the time to troubleshoot and get feedback helped me get past those challenges.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  
  Working on these projects has taught me to think more carefully about how I design programs. I have also started focusing on things like scalability and how future changes may impact my code. I have also realized the importance of starting with a solid plan, breaking problems into smaller piecees, and testing as I go. These habits have provided me more confidence in my ability to take on bigger programing tasks.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 
  I have improved when it comes to writing clean and readable code by paying more attention to using clear variable names, writing helpful comments, and sticking to consistent formatting. These might seem like small things, but they make a huge difference when someone else needs to read or work with your code. I also learned how to strucutre my programs in a way that makes them easier to adapt if requirements
